<p style="font-size:10px;"> Raghu Engineering College was established in 2001 and is situated on the excellent pasture of 50 acres of land and is just 25 minutes away from the RTC complex and Railway station of Visakhapatnam, AP, India. It strives to equip its students with the required conceptual, technical, and managerial skills to grab the emerging opportunities and meet the ever-increasing demands and requirements of the information technology and manufacturing sectors. The institute is determined to produce efficient and impeccable technological professionals to cater to the technology needs of society and to effectively shoulder the ever-changing business responsibilities at national and international levels.</p>
<p style="font-size:10px"> Both Academia – industry collaborations and the MOUs encourage improving the quality and quantity of teaching, research, innovations, human resource, and thus the financial sources of the institution. The adequate and well established and equipped labs give ample opportunities for the students to do experiments. Sports, games, and cultural activities are integral parts of the institute’s curriculum. The NCC and NSS units communicate the importance of unity, discipline, and social services and help build the students’ inner and outer characters. Apart from sophisticated A/C hostels, a huge and hygienic canteen is built on the campus to satiate the hunger and thirst of students satisfactorily.</p>
