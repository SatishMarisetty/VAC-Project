It strives to equip its students with the required conceptual, technical, and managerial skills to grab the emerging opportunities and meet the ever-increasing demands and requirements of the information technology and manufacturing sectors. The institute is determined to produce efficient and impeccable technological professionals to cater to the technology needs of society and to effectively shoulder the ever-changing business responsibilities at national and international levels.</p>
<p style="font-size:15px; cell-padding:30px;"> Both Academia – industry collaborations and the MOUs encourage improving the quality and quantity of teaching, research, innovations, human resource, and thus the financial sources of the institution. The adequate and well established and equipped labs give ample opportunities for the students to do experiments.
